###Data Wrangling report for capstone project

There are four different data files provided.

**File 1** - There are 21 records with 0 longitude and 0 latitude. -  We decided to ignore these values for now.  

There is one record with -1 value in Id. - we decided to ignore this record.  

**File 2** - There is one record with -1 value in Id. - we decided to ignore this record.   
Most records has same laden and ballast speed - at the time of contract they decide one speed irrespective of laden or ballast.  
There are 8 vessels with built-in year as 0 - we will receive updated dates.  
There are many records where dates are not updated - we will receive updated dates.  

**File 3** - For single Voyage there are multiple records in this file.  
For eg. for Voyage = 14, there are 15 rows in this file where there are different data_type A,
E and P (Actual, Estimate and Position) where P as has mostly NA values. Other difference is different batch_Id. Another difference is Fkey_id - which is related to type.  

There are 269 records where port of first load and last discharge are -1. - possibility is that they are cancelled voyages.  

There are 13 CompleteGMT records where date is 2051. - these records look like outliers. They are long term contracts.  

**File 4** - Actual earnings could be negative, zero or positive. Zero earnings could indicate that voyage got cancelled.  
Id has a value of -1 for few records -  we decided to ignore these records.  
First load port and last discharge port has blank values - It could mean that voyages got cancelled.  

After considering all these factors from the data and cleaning up the data, now data is ready for further analysis.
