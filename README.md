# Capstone Project - Maritime Data Intelligence System

This project is a part of my internship project at Pythian Technologies Pvt. Ltd. The material in this repository is created for Capstone project for Springboard Introduction to Data Science course. This course teaches various steps like data wrangling, data exploraion, data visualization, statistical analysis and machine learning. The project is done using R language.

**Project Details**-   

**Client** –  Ship chartering/contracting business company

**Data** – The dataset was received from the ship chartering company.
The dataset includes about 185,000 observations which has voyages from 2009 across the world. The other datasets are Port details, Vessel details and Voyage details. 

**Description** – The objective of this project is to maximize the revenues in ship chartering/ contracting business through efficient operational planning and optimization of resources. Develop a predictive model for the client to maximise the revenue.  

**Approach** – The application will be developed in the R statistical programming language using the Shiny framework.  

Data Story -  Is it possible to create a predictive model that can help improve the business? Is It possible to find independent variables that has some predictive power.  

Data Wrangling - Data was cleaned and reformatted using dplyr and lubridate packages.  

Data Exploration/Visualization - Examined each independent variable. For Visualization ggplot2 package was used.  

Machine Learning - Applied linear regression algorithm to create a model for prediction of the revenue.  

**Deliverables** – R code, project report and presentation based on the results.
