# Capstone Project - Maritime Data Intelligence System

As a capstone project I am working as a Data Science Intern at Pythian Technologies Pvt. Ltd. This material in this repository is created for Capstone project for Springboard Introduction to Data Science course. The project is done using R language.

**Project Details**-   

**Client** –  Ship chartering/contracting business company

**Data** – The dataset was received from the ship chartering company.
The dataset includes about 185,000 observations which has voyages from 2009 across the world. The other datasets are Port details, Vessel details and Voyage details. 

**Description** – The objective of this project is to maximize the revenues in ship chartering/ contracting business through efficient operational planning and optimization of resources. Develop a predictive model for the client to maximise the revenue. Another part of the project is to improve visualization for existing Dashboard data.

**Approach** – The application will be developed in the R statistical programming language using the Shiny framework.  

Data Story -  Is it possible to create a predictive model that can help improve the business? Is It possible to find independent variables that has some predictive power.  

Data Wrangling - Data was cleaned and reformatted using dplyr and lubridate packages.  

Data Exploration/Visualization - Examined each independent variable. For Visualization ggplot2 package was used.  

Machine Learning - Applied linear regression algorithm to create a model for prediction of the revenue.  

**Deliverables** – R and Shiny code, presentation on the results
